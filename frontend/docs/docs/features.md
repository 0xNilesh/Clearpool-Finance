# Features

Clearpool Finance offers a comprehensive suite of features designed to make decentralized investing accessible, secure, and transparent. Our platform serves two primary user groups: **Investors** seeking professional fund management, and **Fund Managers** looking to create and manage investment strategies.

## For Investors

### Secure Fund Management
